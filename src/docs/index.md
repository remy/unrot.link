Link rot is a side effect of the web that can typically affect long running web sites, blogs being a good example of this.

This service aims to provide a hosted solution that progressively enhances the user experience for your visitors by providing a background check that the particular click link is still online.

If the document is no longer online, an archive copy from web.archive.org is returned. Optionally the archived copy from the time _your_ content was created can be retrieved for more complete context as to why you linked to that resource in the first place.
