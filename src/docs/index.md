Link rot is a side effect of the web that can typically affect long running web sites. Blogs especially being a good example of sites that can suffer from link rot.

This service aims to provide a hosted solution that progressively enhances the user experience for your visitors by providing a background check to test if the particular click link is still online.

If the document is no longer online, a copy from the Internet Archive is returned.

Optionally the archived copy from the time that _your_ content was created can be retrieved, for a more complete context as to why you linked to that resource in the first place.
